        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I am a junior frontend developer based in Meckelfeld, Germany.
            I have gained experience in developing web and mobile applications with Angular and Javascript.
            Friends of mine are software developers. They told me about programming and I found it very interesting.
            So I used the chance in Developer Akademie to dive into projects and new challanges.
            Now my enthusiasm turned into a passion.
